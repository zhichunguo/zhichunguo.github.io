**Hi, I am Zhichun Guo!**

I am a fifth-year (2019-now) Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at University of Notre Dame, supervised by [Prof. Nitesh Chawla](https://niteshchawla.nd.edu/). My research interests lie in graph machine learning, AI for Chemistry, Link Prediction, and Trustworthy AI.
